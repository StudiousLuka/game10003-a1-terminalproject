# game10003-a1-terminalproject
I call this game "The Sutherland Mansion". It is a short text adventure created for my Interactive Terminal Project in my Game Development Foundations course.

Instructions:
Download the bairos-luka-a1-interactiveterminal folder. Everything inside it is necessary.
Open bairos-luka-a1-interactiveterminal.sln in Visual Studio and run the program.
When prompted, enter a word or a number depending on the context.
When prompted with a choice between option 1) or option 2), only enter either "1" or "2" without the quotation marks, nothing else.
Try to get the good ending, and be honest!
